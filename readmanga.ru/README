This set of scripts is intended to help you fetch manga from readmanga.ru. It
downloads specified chapters of a given manga title.

Scripts are hosted by w3crapcli project [1]

How to Install
==============

All you need to do is place scripts in some directory mentioned in your PATH
environment variable. You can either create separate directory for scripts like
that and add it to your PATH, or you can copy scripts somewhere. Choose
whichever way you like.


Usage
=====

First you need to obtain URLs of chapters. To accomplish that, call
readmangachapters with manga title as an argument.

$ readmangachapters grenadier

If title consist of few words separated with spaces, you don't need to escape
them:

$ readmangachapters air gear

readmangachapters would dump a list of URLs with chapters' titles. Choose
whichever you want to download and call readmangaget with each of them, one at
at time. For example, to get few chapters of Grenadier you may call:

$ readmangaget 'http://readmanga.ru/grenadier/vol1/1?mature=1'
$ readmangaget 'http://readmanga.ru/grenadier/vol1/2?mature=1'

Note that readmangaget won't create any directories and all the files would be
stored in a current working directory, so that's you who is responsible for
sorting and storing it in a structured way.


There's two additional scripts called readmangasearch and readmangainfo. Former
allows you to simply search site for a manga of your desire - just specify the
title and you'll get URLs of possible candidates:

$ readmangasearch naruto

Second script allows you to view some information (like author, number of
volumes, translation status and description) about specified title:

$ readmangainfo grenadier


Dependencies
============

POSIX compatible shell (BASH, dash etc). /bin/sh should be it or symlink to it
coreutils
curl
wget
perl
urlencode, htmldecode (both can be found at w3crapcli under the utils directory)

All the scripts depends on readmangasearch so they can search for title if user
didn't specify URL.
