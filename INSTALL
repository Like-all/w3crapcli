How to install scripts from w3crapcli
=====================================

There're plenty of options:

1) some scripts got Makefiles and/or INSTALL files - check them out

2) you can always move scripts to some directory mentioned in your PATH
   environment variable. Note, though, that this way it's harder to mantain
   scripts up-to-date (you would need to move new versions, too).

3) some scripts are supported outside w3crapcli project. One may fetch them
   using `get-aliens.sh' script.
