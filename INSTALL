How to install scripts from w3crapcli
=====================================

There're plenty of options:

1) some scripts got Makefiles and/or INSTALL files - check them out

2) use the power of Unix called "union mount". Check out manpage for mount(8),
   then issue following command for any directory in the project's root dir:

     # mount --bind DIRNAME /bin

   Of course, DIRNAME should be substituted by real dirname, like "utils",
   "savefrom" or else.

   Note that some scripts may depend on others, so you may need to "bind" more
   directories to make it all work. Most reused tools are collected in "utils"
   directory.

3) you can always move scripts to some directory mentioned in your PATH
   environment variable. Note, though, that this way it's harder to mantain
   scripts up-to-date (you would need to move new versions, too).
