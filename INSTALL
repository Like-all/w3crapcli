How to install scripts from w3crapcli
=====================================

There're plenty of options:

1) some scripts got Makefiles and/or INSTALL files - check them out

2) you can always symlink scripts to some directory mentioned in your PATH
   environment variable. Note, though, that some scripts may depend on other
   scripts, and you should put them into your PATH too.

3) some scripts are supported outside w3crapcli project. One may fetch them
   using `get-aliens.sh' script.
